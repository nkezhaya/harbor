# Harbor

Harbor is an unreleased, open-source e-commerce toolkit built with Elixir, Phoenix 1.8, and LiveView 1.1. It ships opinionated domain contexts, a LiveView-powered admin experience, and infrastructure pieces that make it easier to spin up a custom storefront.

## Status

Harbor is pre-release software. Expect breaking changes and unfinished workflows while we build out the core commerce features.
